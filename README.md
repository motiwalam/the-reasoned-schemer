# The Reasoned Schemer
Working through the code from The Reasoned Schemer (2018 edition).

## Files

The `trs2-impl.rkt` and `trs2-arith.rkt` are Racket adaptations of the [official accompanying Scheme code](https://github.com/TheReasonedSchemer2ndEd/CodeFromTheReasonedSchemer2ndEd).

Each `chap<i>.rkt` contains code fragments jotted down from and/or inspired by the corresponding chapter from the book.
